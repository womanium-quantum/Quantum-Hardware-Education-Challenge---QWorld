    "The purpose of this course is to introduce the student to the field of Topological Quantum Computing (TQC). Starting with some reminders on quantum computing, and an introduction to Classical and Quantum Error Correction, we delve into the 2D world of Anyons and Topological Qubits. We then learn how to manipulate these topological qubits to perform computations: first on a single qubit, and then on two qubits. Although, for the purposes of introducing TQC, single-qubit gates are enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "The student can also apply the acquired knowledge of TQC up to this point using the Anyons Simulator. Multiple qubits, and even qudits, can be simulated with an arbitrary number of anyons for each qubit/qudit.<br>\n",
    "Just as described in Anyons section, the student can choose any computational basis to work with."

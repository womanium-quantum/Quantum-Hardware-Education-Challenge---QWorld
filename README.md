## Content

This course contains several notebooks introducing the reader to Topological Quantum Computing (TQC). The main notebook is 'intro_content.ipynb' which contains the outline of the course as well as the links to all other notebooks.

The notebooks contain reminders on the basics of Quantum Computing, introductions to Classical and Quantum Error Corrections, theoretical notions on Anyons, practical computations with Anyons along with exercices and quizzes, and a description of an approach to implementing Topological Qubits, namely, the Toric Code.

Quizzes on the subject are to be found in the "Quiz_B" and "Quiz_C" PDF file.

To make it easier for teachers or the Womanium Hackathon jury to read the notebooks, the solutions to the tasks/exercises were not hidden.

### The Simulator

In addition to the educational material, a fully functional Anyons Simulator has been created and used throughout the course. It can be used by students to simulate topological qubits with any number of anyons, and perform any sequence of braiding operations on them, as well as measure the outcome of the computation.
